Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?
 As of now, my team member and I have created the players, the invaders, and the bullet using pygames as a helpful tool to build this game. 


#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We still have to move the default icon that would move and hit the enemies. We have been having some diffucilites in aligning the bullet and moving the icon from right to left. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

There have been a lot of problems that we have encountered. As stated in the previous part, we have had some issues aligning the bulletin and moving the icon from right to left. We have not come to this spot as of yet but I belive we will also have some trouble in counting the points as the bullet hits the invaders.
