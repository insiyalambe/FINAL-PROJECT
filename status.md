Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?
 We have created the bot and have taken input from the user in the correct format which will allow us to go in a data base to correspond how many covid cases and other number related to that specific date there were. 


#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We still have to code the part that goes into the data base and return the covid numbers which we can then print.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

We have not encountered any problems yet as we were able to watch many videos on how to create the bot. But regarding the acutally coding part, we are sure we will encounter some issues but we have alot of resources in help from TA and Professor Rosen that we are sure will be helpful to us.
