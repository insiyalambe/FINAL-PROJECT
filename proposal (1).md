# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Space Invaders with a twist

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My team member and I decided to create space invaders on pygame but we though to change it up we would keep the enemies at a constant spot while the user will be able to hit as many enemies as possible in a minute. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My partner and I wanted to create a game that we have played as childhood. We both came to realize that space invaders was one of our favorite games so having the oppounrity to create this was a dream come true. Our project is relating to space invaders but instead of the enemies moving around and the user has to hit it, we thought it would be fun to all create the enemies staying in their constant spot and the user as to hit as many enemies as possible in a minute or less. Professor recommended to us to use pygames so our plan is to first look at pygames and understand its aspects as we have never used it. Next, we plan on doing some outside research to see what this type of spciefic code needs as we are confused on where to start and need to understand the terminology. After that using pycharm and idle, we plan to write the code for certain feature that have been on on Space invader such as bulletin, enemies, the spaceship and most important thing for bulletin to hit the enemies and count the points. 
## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will accomplishing using the pygame to create spaceship, enemies, and bullets

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Before the final project's deadline, my partner and I hope to acomplish creating the features and to create a point score so that when the bullit hits the enemy it will get counted. 
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The Best outcome would for the spaceship to hit the enemies, while the enemies are moving and possible create a loop so it can be played over and over again. 
## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Our next step is to look at pygames and understand it concept and how we can effciently use it to our benefit in terms of understanding the terminology and therefore using it to build our code. We also plan on doing external research that would help us start to code as we are confused on how to start and how we can greate the display.
